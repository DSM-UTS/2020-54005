# Zotero group library

We have set up a Zotero group library. The library contains all the required and optional readings for the subject. But you are also invited to collavorate to the library by adding at least one essay.

## What is Zotero

> Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you
collect, organize, cite, and share research.

There is plenty of information about Zotero on the [official website](https://www.zotero.org/).

## How to use the group library

1. You need to create a Zotero account, which is totally free and only requires you to provide a username and your UTS email address (or any other email address).
2. You need to be a member of the group library (check your email, because you should have received an invitation email...).
3. You need to be logged in.
4. Now you can start collaborating with the library!
